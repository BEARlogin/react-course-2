## TASKS for the React Advanced course ##

The starting code are:
1) Frontend (npm i, then **npm run start** in the **react** folder): http://localhost:3000 
2) Backend (npm i, then **npm run start** in the **root** folder, the server starts on port 8000).


A CSV checklist of completed tasks must be attached to the solution
(http://localhost:8000/checklist.html).
Recommended to use GitHub classroom to share the solutions.

### TASKS ###

1. Optimize component redrawing using memoization (React.memo, React.callback, etc.)	
2. Use the saga to get information about books, with the ability to change the requested book, stop downloading from the server, handle the error, if the server is unavailable
